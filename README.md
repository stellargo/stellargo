### Hi there!

I am Sumit. You can read more about my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project on externalizing the fingerprinting engine for Jenkins [here](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/external-fingerprint-storage/).

### Projects I have built and actively maintain:
- [Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/redis-fingerprint-storage-plugin) for Jenkins
- [PostgreSQL Fingerprint Storage Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/postgresql-fingerprint-storage-plugin) for Jenkins

### Some PRs in huge projects I am proud of:
- [External Fingerprint storage API](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4731) in Jenkins core
- [Fingerprint migration support](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4825) in Jenkins core
- [Fingerprint cleanup support for External Fingerprint Storage API](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4817) in Jenkins core
- [Built 'HTTPSBear' linter to automatically replace HTTP links with working HTTPS versions in coala](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2063/files) in coala
- [Developed feature to allow including header files for â€˜CPPCleanBearâ€™ using the CppClean linter](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2037/files) in coala

### Some of my deep learning projects related to vision and speech:
- [Labeling Satellite Images with Atmospheric Conditions and Land Cover](https://github.com/stellargo/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/AN%20IMAGE%20SEGMENTATION%20PROBLEM/ImageSegmentationProblem.ipynb)
- [Emotion Recognition from Audio Clips](https://github.com/stellargo/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/SPEECH%20EMOTION%20PROBLEM/SpeechEmotion.ipynb)

### Some blogs I have authored:
- [VGGNet vs ResNet (The Vanishing Gradient Problem)](https://towardsdatascience.com/vggnet-vs-resnet-924e9573ca5c)
- [Exploring Image Data Augmentation with Keras and Tensorflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-image-data-augmentation-with-keras-and-tensorflow-a8162d89b844)
